## Usage

In your terminal type in shotgun and after shotgun starts up look at the "Listening on" line and the last four digits will be used to get the webpage in your browser using the localhost server. 
Example:
// â™¥  shotgun
== Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
2021-04-01 01:44:02 -0400 Thin web server (v1.8.0 codename Possessed Pickle)
2021-04-01 01:44:02 -0400 Maximum connections set to 1024
2021-04-01 01:44:02 -0400 Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop

In the browser you would use the URL localhost:9393 to pull up the webpage.
